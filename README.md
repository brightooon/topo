The commits can be thought of as having the structure of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the commits being the vertices. In particular, one can create a directed edge from each child commit to each of its parent commits. Alternatively, one can create a directed edge from each parent to each of its children. If a commit is a merge commit, it will have two or more parents. In that case, one has to consider all parents. Conversely, a parent can have two or more children if two or more distinct branches emerge from the parent

Generate a topological ordering of the commits in the graph, using DFS, and Print the commit hashes in the order generated by the previous step, from the least to the greatest.

Follow [test-suite instruction](https://github.com/Rustinante/topo-ordered-commits-test-suite) to run the topo_order_commit test cases.
